Elise and I recently got really into Aziz Ansari via his new Netflix show, "Master of None" (watch it!). We also went through all of his stand-up comedy specials that are on Netflix, then read this book. It's a good book, but in it, Ansari covers a lot of ground that he already addresses in his stand-up--and he is much, much funnier in stand-up than he is in print. The book got a couple of chuckles out of me, but not nearly the crack-up level of "Dangerously Delicious" et al.<br /><br />I think Elise and I are late to the Aziz party since many people already knew him from Parks &amp; Rec, but if this book introduces more people to him, so much the better. Besides being really funny, he talks about a lot of important issues, and maintains a generally positive outlook in a field that trades heavily on cynicism a lot of the time.
