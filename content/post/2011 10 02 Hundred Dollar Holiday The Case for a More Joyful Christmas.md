Nice little (very little!) book. It doesn't break a ton of new ground, but it was interesting learning about the evolution of the celebration of Christmas over time. I find McKibben very refreshing in his willingness to critique the status quo of commercialism without positing some superior golden age in the past. Instead, his writing is a challenge to "make it new" for our own time.
