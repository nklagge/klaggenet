I never had to read this book in middle school, and I figured since it won the Hugo and Nebula awards (big sci-fi book awards), I might like it. That turned out to be pretty much not right. The book has a clever and interesting premise--a mentally disabled guy is scientifically transformed into a genius and then regresses back--but I don't think it has much more than that. Probably a good book for middle-schoolers to read, but if you missed it like I did, I wouldn't really advise going back to it.
