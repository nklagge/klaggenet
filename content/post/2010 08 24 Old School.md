Once my mom and Elise both said I would like this, I had to pick it up. I finished it in about two days and really enjoyed it. The setting is a New England prep school and as such it reminded me some of George Orwell's essay "Such, Such Were The Joys" (though not as acid). Wolff writes simply and enjoyably; his prose is a quick read but still interesting. He works in appearances by Robert Frost, Ayn Rand, and (sort of) Ernest Hemingway, which is fun, and motivated me to read some of each of those writers' work (of which more soon). Elise has been reading "This Boy's Life", and I liked "Old School" enough that I definitely intend to read that one at some point.
