This was a second read. The first time I read this book was either when I was in undergrad or shortly after I graduated, and at that time it put me off of applying to PhD programs. Having decided to apply, I figured I should read it again. It didn't put me off this time. I think on the previous read-through, I didn't feel like I could say I was sure I wanted to go to a doctoral program, which many of the interviewees in this book say is an important thing to be sure of (for good reason). I also felt unsure of my ability to find my own academic path, and worried that I would end up just being shaped by my advisers. Now, I feel less worried about both of those things, and ready to apply!
