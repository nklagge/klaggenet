Second post-wedding graphic novel. My dad and stepmom got this for me at the "Anne Frank House" museum in Amsterdam. I did appreciate reading it, as somehow I have never read AF's diary, so I only knew the story in its broadest outline. But I thought this book fell short in that it didn't take advantage of any of the manifold possibilities of the graphic novel, in contrast to something like (to take an example covering similar subject matter) "Maus." This is a straightforward telling of the story, and the pictures perhaps would serve to make the story more interesting for kids, but in my view, didn't do anything to enhance the reading experience. Overall I think I would rather have read the diary itself!
