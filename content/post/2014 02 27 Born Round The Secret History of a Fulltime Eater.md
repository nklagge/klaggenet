I am a big fan of Frank Bruni's op-ed column in the New York Times, so I thought it would be fun to read his book. Unfortunately, it ended up being pretty disappointing to me. As I perhaps should have realized from the title--as well as the Dewey Decimal location at the library--this is largely a book about Bruni's struggles with eating and his weight; not really what I felt interested to read about. Overall, the book felt very navel-gazing, and I didn't really feel like I came away from it with anything new. I guess I much prefer Bruni writing about social and political issues than writing about himself.
