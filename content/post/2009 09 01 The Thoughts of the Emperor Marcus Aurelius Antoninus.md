Downloaded the free Kindle version of this onto my iPod and had it as a backup subway read for those times when I happened to be without my current book. It's written in a perfect format for reading this way--the title is pretty accurate; it's just a collection of thoughts, so it's OK to read just every once in a while. Most of its content was familiar to me and would be to anyone with a little knowledge of Stoic philosophy. Still, there were some striking passages, and it's good stuff to be reminded of on a daily basis. I probably would have preferred a more modern translation, but this is the one that was available for free.
