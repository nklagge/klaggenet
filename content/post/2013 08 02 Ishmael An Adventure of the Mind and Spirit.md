This was a book that Dad read aloud to us when we were little, and I just finished reading it aloud to Elise (over a somewhat extended period of time, as is usual with our read-alouds). I was glad to read it again, as I only had pretty general memories of it from the first time around. I especially like the book's glosses on the ancient stories from Genesis. However, I thought it dragged a little as a read-aloud since there is basically no action--without a set reading schedule, we'd often go a while without reading it since no one was on the edge of his or her seat wondering what would happen next!
