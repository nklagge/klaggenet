"Boxers" and "Saints" are two companion books by the same author. They tell the parallel stories of two (fictional) teenagers involved in the Boxer Rebellion in late-nineteenth-century China--one a boy who is on the side of the Chinese nationalist boxers, one a girl who is a Chinese Christian convert, part of a group that incurred the wrath of the boxers. <br /><br />The characters are both pretty interesting, and their imaginative relationships with Chin Shih-Huang and Joan of Arc (respectively) add a really cool quasi-fantastical element to the story. That said, some plot elements seemed out-of-character for the protagonists, and the ending was pretty sad.
