If you've ready my review of Turkle's previous book, "Alone Together," you'll know that I'm a big fan of hers. I think her message in "Reclaiming Conversation" continues to be thoughtful and needed. It's only three stars for me, though, just because it retraces a lot of the same ground as AT, but in more of a hortatory than an expositional mode. There's nothing wrong with that per se, and I hope that it will open up her message to a wider audience who might not have been ready to delve into the somewhat less accessible previous book. Maybe it is a personal reaction on my part--the content of AT put me very much in the mindset that she advances in RC, so the latter book ended up feeling somewhat superfluous.
