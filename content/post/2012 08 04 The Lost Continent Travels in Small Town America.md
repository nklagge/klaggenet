Elise and I read most of this book aloud on our camping vacation in Maine and New Hampshire. I got a few LOLs out of it, but didn't enjoy it as much as "A Walk In The Woods." Mainly, BB is so mean! Perhaps I liked AWITW better because it was the first BB book I read; here, the humor seemed mostly predictable to me.
