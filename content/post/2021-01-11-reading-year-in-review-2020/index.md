{{% newthought %}} A strange year for reading, {{% /newthought %}} to be sure. You might think that COVID lockdowns would provide more time for reading, but I think my total amount of reading for the year was about average. Part of this was having less time on trains and planes, which in the past has been a prime reading time for me. Part of it was also getting a Nintendo Switch; much reading time was surely sacrificed to "Breath of the Wild" (no regrets though!).

The biggest development in my reading world was finally starting this website. I already wrote a lot about my motivation for doing it in the [about page](/about/), so I won't re-hash it here. But a couple of months in, I'm feeling good about it. I've had the chance to write a few longer or more complex pieces that wouldn't really have fit the mold at Goodreads, and I haven't felt self-pressure to write more, publicize more, etc. It's a nice place to have. Also, my decision to "take out" all my Goodreads data was totally validated by the fact that just a few weeks later, they closed down their API (the interface that lets you programatically pull down your own reading data) without any warning. So unfortunately my [post about that](/post/2020-10-18-liberating-your-goodreads-reviews/) is now obsolete, except as a historical artifact.

I did continue keeping tabs on my male/female author ratio--despite my professed desire to have a less quantitative relationship with books, it's a commitment that still feels important to me--and managed to keep it even. I also continued the trend I started in 2019 of putting books down if I wasn't that into them, and in fact did that a lot more this year--I DNF'd about 10 books, with a couple more where I intentionally only read certain parts of them that interested me. {{% sidenote %}}Do those count as DNF? The answer is, [who cares!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_tupPBtWQ){{% /sidenote %}}

In terms of the practicalities of reading in 2020, the MVP for me was unquestionably the Libby app, which lets you put holds on and check out e-books from libraries. With my local library either closed or limited-access for much of the year, I relied really heavily on Libby, and bought from indie bookstores when I couldn't find a book there (mostly [The Lit Bar](https://bookshop.org/shop/thelitbar) in the Bronx and [RJ Julia](https://www.rjjulia.com/) here in Connecticut). 

A few of my favorite books from the last year:  
- [*The Steerswoman*](/post/2020-01-25-the-steerswoman/) by Rosemary Kirstein, and its sequel *The Outskirter's Secret*--looking forward to reading the other two books in the series soon.
- [*Descender, Vol. 1*](/post/2020-02-16-descender-vol-1-tin-stars/) by Jeff Lemire and Dustin Nguyen--my local library doesn't have any of the later volumes, and I don't want to read comics in e-book format. Maybe it's time to buy the next one!
- [*The Night Watchman*](/post/2020-03-29-the-night-watchman/) by Louise Erdrich--I gave this to multiple people as a gift this year. Had been meaning to read something by her for a while, and this was a great place to start.
- [*Race for Profit*](/post/2020-06-28-race-for-profit-how-banks-and-the-real-estate-industry-undermined-black-homeownership/) by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor--I didn't know much about racism in the US housing market from 1970-2000, and learned a lot from this book, which I also enjoyed discussing with my partner.
- [*1919*](/post/2020-06-30-1919/) by Eve Ewing - I don't read much poetry, and I'd like to read more. Eve Ewing is the one poet who I know I love!
- [*The Ballad of Black Tom*](/post/2020-07-03-the-ballad-of-black-tom/) by Victor LaValle--a masterclass in taking something problematic and making it new.
- [*Caste*](/post/2020-10-21-the-bones-of-our-house/) by Isabel Wilkerson--I've given this as a gift and had a lot of conversations based on it with others who have read it.

If I have a "reading resolution" for 2021, besides continuing to write on this site, it's to be a bit more intentional in my reading. For the most part, my reading is a pretty haphazard combination of things I hear about that sound interesting, ordered according to when I get them off the library hold list, and somewhat shaped by my intentional approach to reading more women. But if I can say one thing I've found so far from doing more expansive book reviewing on this site, it's that I enjoy having a couple of related books I can think and write about together, on a topic that matters to me.{{% sidenote %}}Seems kind of obvious when I write it out like that!{{% /sidenote %}} That happened somewhat coincidentally on a couple of occasions in 2020, but I'd like to do it more intentionally in 2021.
