I may have jumped the gun a bit in reading this book, but I got so excited about working in school leadership that I couldn't help it. The reason I'm not giving it more than three stars is that I think it will become much more helpful to me when I am a practitioner than it is at the moment. At any rate, it provided a good mix of insights that I relate to from my own socioprofessional experiences and ones that seem new and useful to me. 

My rating: 3 stars
