Picked this up in a used bookstore on a whim. Not a bad light read. It's mostly about the experience of being a homebrewer, though it does have a couple of recipes in the back. It was interesting to read since it was written before the American craft beer renaissance. In all, it made me feel somewhat disinclined to try all-grain brewing and definitely disinclined to ever try to start a brewery, but encouraged to continue in my partial-mash forays.
