A comic book winner. I had been a little disappointed with Powers but decided to try out another recommendation from Matt. I read this in one evening and I think I am even appreciating it more than "Watchmen" right now. It takes itself a lot less seriously, but I think it still has important things to say. Spider Jerusalem is not exactly a likable character, but he's very complex and well-portrayed. Sometimes the book was a little too scatological for my taste, but I think that's an important part of its portrayal of society. Looking forward to the next volume.
