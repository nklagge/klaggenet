The proof of the adventure will be in the playing, of course, and I have just started DMing this campaign for a group of four friends. We've had two sessions so far, and they've just gotten through the "Death House" introductory adventure. But I have read through the book and really like it on the whole. The Gothic atmosphere of Barovia/Ravenloft is very well written, and Strahd is a great antagonist. Prepping for this campaign also got me to read Bram Stoker's _Dracula_, which was pretty good. I've already done a little customizing, but by and large the adventure seems very usable "out of the box."<br /><br />I'm very curious to see where my players will take this campaign. My one criticism so far is that the book makes Strahd out to be more totally evil than I would prefer him to be (and than I will play him as being). I think a more tragic approach is appropriate for a Gothic horror setting, and I also see a lot in Strahd's backstory that makes him seem sympathetic at least in certain ways. 

My rating: 4 stars
