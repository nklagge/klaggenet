The final book (for now) in my recent Hauerwas "tear", this work finds Hauerwas specifically orienting his theological position toward an ethic of nonviolence (or "peaceability"). I am glad to have read this shortly before MLK day, and it certainly has helped me appreciate the deep training in virtue that is a necessary prerequisite for the successful practice of nonviolence. Hauerwas (even if somewhat reluctant personally) takes up nonviolence as the epitome of Christian virtue, and also outlines the deep challenges that are involved in the acceptance of that. This is a book that I have thought about quite a bit as I've started going to church regularly again.
