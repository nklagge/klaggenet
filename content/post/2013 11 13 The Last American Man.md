Read on Elise's recommendation; glad I did. After reading this, I am not surprised that EG's other book "Eat Pray Love" was such a hit. She (a New Yorker writer) has an almost pitch-perfect magazine-feature writing style. It's not exactly my favorite type of writing, but I have to admit that she crafts her sentences and narratives very well. Eustace Conway, the subject of the book, is an extremely interesting character, and EG does a great job of introducing us to him and revealing various aspects of his character slowly over the course of the book. She also inserts herself into the narrative in a balanced way that I thought added to the story overall.<br /><br />It's hard to say much about the content of the book; it touches on the American character, our relationship with nature, family relationships and conceptions of success. Just read it!

My rating: 4 stars
