This is as good as the first Iron Man/Ironheart volume. I especially liked that there was a supergroup of good-aligned female characters constantly interacting and playing off one another in interesting ways: Riri Williams, Maria Stark, Sharon Carter, Virginia Potts, Mary Jane Watson, and the AI FRIDAY.

My rating: 4 stars
