Umm, how could I not love a team-up of Gene Luen Yang ("American Born Chinese", "Boxers and Saints", "Level Up") and Sonny Liew ("The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye")?? This is not one of those disappointing supergroups!<br /><br />The content, characterization, and pacing of this comic are perfect for me. The violence is minimal and never played for grittiness, so that when a key character is killed you really feel the shock of it. (I would definitely feel comfortable giving this book to a pre-teen to read.) The main character, Hank, and his mom and dad (as well as his mom's ex-boyfriend) are very relatable and likeable characters. There are quite a few clever twists in the story and many tropes are subverted. <br /><br />What puts this book over the threshold from awesome to great is the connection to the actual mid-century comic "The Green Turtle," which Yang explains in an extremely interesting postscript. In short, TGT is an actual but obscure historical comic written in the '40s by a Chinese American author about a superhero defending America's ally China against imperial Japan. Yang describes the rumor that the author wanted the GT to be Chinese-American, but his publisher would never have accepted it, so the comic is carefully drawn to maintain ambiguity (you never see the GT's face). I love that Yang and Liew unearthed this midcentury relic for an origin story, and I especially loved recognizing all of the retcons scattered throughout the book to justify weird or inexplicable quirks of the original source material.<br /><br />I have to assume this has a very low likelihood of becoming a big-screen superhero movie, but man--it really should!

My rating: 5 stars
