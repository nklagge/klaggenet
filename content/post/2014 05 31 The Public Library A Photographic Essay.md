Nice book of both photographs and a number of short essays on public libraries, one of my favorite things. I am looking forward to visiting the Salt Lake City public library next time I travel there for work. One nice Easter egg in this book is an essay about the library written by Amy Tan at age 8, for which she won an essay contest.
