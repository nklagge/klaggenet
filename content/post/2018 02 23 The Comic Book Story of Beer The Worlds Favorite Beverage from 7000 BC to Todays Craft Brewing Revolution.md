I thought this was just OK. There's a lot of decent information about the history of beer, although most of it was already familiar to me. (I did, however, learn that there is now a certified Trappist monastery brewery in Spencer, Massachusetts!) Ultimately I didn't feel like the book did anything in particular to leverage the graphic novel format--the illustrations don't have a strong characteristic style, nor did they seem to tell the story any better than you could tell it in words. (But if you just used words, I guess it wouldn't have been enough for a book!) Finally, negative points for some unnecessarily sexualized illustrations of women (primarily of the Sumerian beer goddess Ninkasi).
