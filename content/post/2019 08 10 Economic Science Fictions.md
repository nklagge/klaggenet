I love the idea of this collection, but it consistently didn't work for me. I thought most of the essays/stories were not very well written, and skipped a couple because of that. I think a better way to engage with the idea of "economic science fictions" may be just to read/watch sci-fi where the economics are an important part of the story. "The Dispossessed" and "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" come to mind.

My rating: 2 stars
