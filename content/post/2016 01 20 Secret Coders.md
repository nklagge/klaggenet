A fun short comic, but not nearly as engrossing as "American Born Chinese," "Level Up," or "Boxers and Saints." More of a comic book than a graphic novel, really. Teaches some basic programming concepts; I wonder how it would be received by a non-programmer kid.

[My Goodreads rating: 3 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1516694372)
