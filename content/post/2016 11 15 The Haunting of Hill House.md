Elise and I listened to the audiobook version of this as a Halloween celebration. (Over a couple of weeks--even though it's a short book, the total running time is 7.5 hours!) It's an interesting book, sort of an odd combination of psychological thriller and actual horror story. There are a couple of genuinely frightening scenes, but for the most part the story moves a little slowly (maybe this perception is a consequence of listening to the audiobook?). It did make me interested in learning more about the author Shirley Jackson, who is supposedly in part the template for the main character Eleanor.
