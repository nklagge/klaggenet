I read this book because my dad had read it (amusingly we are the only two people to have reviewed it on Goodreads to date), but I ended up being pretty disappointed with it. The author is a psychoanalyst, and his emphasis is fairly heavy on the classic psychoanalytical tropes. In general I find those to be pretty unconvincing, and particularly because I recently read Carol Gilligan's masterful takedown of Freud's theories of moral development.
