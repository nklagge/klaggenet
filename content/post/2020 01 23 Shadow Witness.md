I love Trese but this one fell a little flat for me, especially after a multi-year gap and the amount of effort I put into procuring it (it's only available in the Philippines, and random chance whether it's in any given bookstore--of which there are few in general). Baldisimo's drawing is as good as ever, but I felt like the writing was pretty weak overall. There were a couple of just total non-sequitur jumps in action within a story. In addition, we actually see fairly little of Alexandra Trese, and therefore of her cool mystery solving, in this volume. Some of the stories just focus on her brothers, and while I appreciate the idea of expanding the universe out a bit, they aren't as well fleshed out. The story with the priest brother in particular has a good ultimate reveal, but it's basically an extended fight scene, and would have been much more interesting as extended detective work.
