The eponymous wolf is the proverbial "wolf at the door" when times are lean. MFKF wrote this book basically about cooking during the rationing and shortages of World War II. It is strange to read this book today and think about the huge impact that War had on Americans' lives in the 1940s, even though almost none of the conflict took place on American soil, and contrast that with the near-zero impact of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars on my own life. Nonetheless, the book is surprisingly accessible and relatable. It is no survivalist fantasia; rather, MFKF seems to use the state of exigency as just an intensifier to bring into relief the values and opinions that she already holds on food and its appropriate role in our lives.
