This book was an impulse purchase at the new King memorial in DC. It's an interesting topic, but I think ended up not to be a very compelling read. I do think it's worth knowing how much King involved himself with the labor movement, and understanding his views on things like industrial automation. However, I think I would have liked the book to have more commentary on the broad sweep of things; this book more or less prints his speeches with a bit of introduction at the beginning of each. Another shortcoming as a book is that, since King was speaking to similar audiences in many different places, his speeches tend to repeat themselves. This is in contrast to a book such as "Strength to Love", where he is writing for the same audience over and over, and thus having to say something new every time.
