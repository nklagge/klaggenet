Not sure I have much to add to the chorus of praise that has gone around for this book, but I do echo it. PK was clearly an extraordinary person and I'm glad he was able to write this book to share his experiences.<br /><br />It's so short, you really have no good reason not to read it!

My rating: 4 stars
