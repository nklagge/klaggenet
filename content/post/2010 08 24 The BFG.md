It had been long enough since I read this that I didn't actually remember what happened in the end, just the general feel (and many specific lines). It was an interesting read-aloud, as at times Elise and I would be laughing so hard neither of us could read, but other times we would get through whole chapters with barely a chuckle. The BFG himself is certainly an unforgettable character, but in my opinion the plot isn't particularly compelling, particularly in comparison with some of Dahl's other books such as "Matilda" or "The Witches".
