Very nice novel. I think many have compared it to "Cloud Atlas" because of the alternating and interlocking stories, but I don't know that I agree. "Cloud Atlas" is very centered on that formalism, with the connections between the various stories being more or less arbitrary. In "TransAtlantic," however, the connections between the stories are much more substantive and relevant to the story itself. In this way, it is more similar to "Roots" (a favorite of mine). I am looking forward to reading "Let The Great World Spin."
