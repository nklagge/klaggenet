I picked this up after really enjoying Ward's later novel, "Sing, Unburied, Sing." StB is also an excellent book--I might have even liked it better. It's set in the same rural Gulf area of Mississippi as the later book (and apparently the StB characters make a cameo in SUS, which of course I didn't realize at the time).<br /><br />The story takes place before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina. Unlike SUS, StB isn't particularly preoccupied with the past--Esch's dead mother is basically the only element of the past introduced in the story. But like SUS--and I'm gathering that this is one of Ward's great strengths as an author--StB is sort of an extended exercise in empathy. The main characters, particularly Esch's brother Skeet, do a bunch of things that, "on paper," would be objectionable to Ward's presumably urban liberal readership: engage in dog-fighting, break into a neighbor's house and steal from them, loot stores after the hurricane. Yet through Ward's quiet portraiture, we can understand where they come from--and in the moment many of them don't even really feel objectionable (or didn't to me). Also, unlike SUS, I thought all of the characters in StB were believably flawed.<br /><br />One choice I found interesting was the extended reference to Medea. Esch is a devoted reader of Greek mythology and is always mentally referring to Medea--a character that, as a reminder, is most famous for murdering her own children in cold blood in order to hurt her husband Jason after he spurns her. [spoilers removed]<br /><br />I also thought the book had an interesting and probably intentional relationship to some of the more saccharine (and white) children's books about kids in nature--Little House on the Prairie, perhaps, or Charlotte's Web. StB is suffused with living nature in all kinds of forms, but Ward portrays it in a more unvarnished way than some of that literature--starting with the somewhat gross opening scene of a dog giving birth to puppies, obviously through to dog fighting itself, to the barbecuing of a squirrel for dinner. Nature is still revered here, almost in a pantheistic way (as in Beston's "The Outermost House")--but revered for both its miracles and its horrors.
