Wow, I loved this, read in one day. Picked it up on a recommendation from a friend, and I am always interested to read Image Comics stuff. The story is compelling, especially the hints at some alternate spiritual plane of being that robots go to when they "die," and the connections revealed between ancient excavations and modern robots. But most of all, I want to praise Dustin Nguyen's artwork. The choice to use watercolors is very unusual for a comic, and provides a nice soft focus that gives our robot heroes a hint of humanity even before the story develops. The subtle nuances he gives Tim-21's facial expressions in flashbacks and "present" scenes gives an indication of the development of a real "person" inside the silicon circuits. And Driller is an awesome bodyguard sidekick. Looking forward to reading volume 2!
