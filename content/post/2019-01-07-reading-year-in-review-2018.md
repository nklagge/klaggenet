I read 63 books in 2018. That is the highest count since 2011 (65)--this is maybe jacked up a little by 6 "Trese" komix volumes that I read pretty quickly. After having dropped my intentional read-more-women program in 2017, I picked it back up in 2018 and successfully read just over 50% women-authored books (32 of 63). This mostly felt easy, although I felt like I had to intentionally play catch-up after the aforementioned 6 male-authored "Trese" books. I'm also expanding the challenge now to include reading more authors of color and LGBT authors, although 50% women is the only quantitative guide I'm keeping. Honestly the easiest rule of thumb is just read books not by white men.

I read 5 books in 2018 that I rated 5-stars:
- *Sex and Social Justice*, by Martha Nussbaum  
- *Mass Murders* (Trese #3), by Budjette Tan and Kajo Baldisimo  
- *Little Manila Is In the Heart*, by Dawn Mabalon  
- *My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*, by Emil Ferris  
- *Adults In the Room*, by Yanis Varoufakis  
- *Journey for Justice*, by Dawn Mabalon and Gayle Romasanta  

As the list above hints, one of my major themes in 2018 was reading more books from and about the Philippines and the Filipino-American experience. My partner's family is from the Philippines and I enjoy learning about it through books as well as through talking with them. I inaugurated a "Filipino" shelf on Goodreads this year (including some retroactive classification of books read in past years, which now has 18 books. In addition to the three books in my 5-star group, I also read five other "Trese" komix volumes, *Insurrecto* and *Gun Dealers' Daughter* by Gina Apostol, *Dogeaters* by Jessica Hagedorn, *Sanpaku* by Kate Gavino, and *America Is Not The Heart* by Elaine Castillo.

I also finally got around to reading the philosopher Martha Nussbaum and read three total books by her (including the 5-star list member mentioned above). The other non-5-star book that has probably stayed with me the most is *Seeing Like a State* by James Scott, which had been on my mental "to-read" list forEVER--I think of it often when I'm having an intellectual discussion about something.

Authors that I saw talk in person (that I can recall right now):
- Kieran Setiya (*Midlife*) at the Brooklyn Public Library Night of Philosophy and Ideas  
- Eve Ewing (*Electric Arches*, *Ghosts in the Schoolyard*, also the new "Ironheart"" comic series!) at The Strand talking about *GITS*  
- N.K. Jemisin ("Broken Earth" trilogy, *How Long Til Black Future Month?*) at The Strand talking about *HLTBFM* (and she signed my copy!)  
- Gina Apostol (*Gun Dealers' Daughter*, *Insurrecto*) at the PEN World Voices Festival (on a panel with Sheila Coronel and Eric Gamalinda)  
- Gina Apostol reading from *Insurrecto* at KGB Bar  
- Dona Wong (*The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics*) whom I met through work because I recruited her to give a talk at a conference  
- This isn't exactly the same but I met Romy Dorotan (*Memories of Philippine Kitchens*) at his restaurant Purple Yam; he sat down and chatted with me and my partner for about 10 minutes!
