Since I'm not doing wedding planning anymore, I've taken the time to read a few graphic novels from our shelves that I've been somewhat interested in but never picked up. This was the first one. Although I think it's pretty good it never really grabbed me or spoke to me personally. I both appreciated and disliked the drawing style: it tends to highlight ugliness, which is totally appropriate to the story of the book, but I can't say I enjoyed it! After all, one of the pleasures of a graphic novel is looking at the pretty pictures.
