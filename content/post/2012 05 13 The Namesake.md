I really enjoyed this book, which I read on Elise's recommendation. I'm not from an immigrant family myself, but I think I'm enough a part of Elise's family now that I recognize many of the issues that Lahiri's characters, both first and second generation, deal with in this book. The only thing I didn't really like was the way the narrative jumped around, explicitly informing you of major events before they are narrated, or neglecting to mention certain events until later in the narrative.
