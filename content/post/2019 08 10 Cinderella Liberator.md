I was unsure how Solnit, one of my very favorite non-fiction writers, would do with kids' fiction (even if a classic story retold). The answer is, wonderfully. Solnit's indefatigable social conscience comes through clearly, as does her affection for ordinary people (and animals!), all wrapped in a story that I think kids would actually enjoy--not simply a twist on a kids' story intended to amuse adults. My favorite part is when the fairy godmother asks the mice, rats, and lizards if they want to stay transformed or not.

My rating: 5 stars
