This is the first in a series held in very high esteem by my comic book loving friend Matt. I definitely enjoyed it but also feel the need to wait to make a judgment on its quality. Matt said he didn't get really into the series until a few books in. So far it doesn't seem to have as much depth of meaning as (say) Watchmen, but I can definitely see how it might get there. 

My rating: 3 stars
