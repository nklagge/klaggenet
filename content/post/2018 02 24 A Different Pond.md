Awesome kids' book. Read because the illustrations are by Thi Bui, who wrote the wonderful _The Best We Could Do_. The story of a kid going fishing with his dad touches on both the comforts of family and the difficulties of day-to-day struggles without being too sentimental about either of them. It's a very quiet book, befitting the pre-dawn setting, and Bui's illustrations capture that feeling really well--of a special time before the rest of the world wakes up.
