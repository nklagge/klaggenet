I only read Billy Budd and Benito Cereno (for Mark's book club), and I was totally underwhelmed by both of them after having liked Moby-Dick and Bartleby pretty well. Neither story had anything approaching interesting characters, and there seemed to be very little in the way of deeper themes explored, in contrast to those other two works.
