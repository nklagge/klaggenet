Read aloud with Elise in preparation for the Mindy Kaling/Reese Witherspoon/Oprah movie version coming out soon! The movie looks pretty fun. I had some exposure to this series of books when I was a kid, but my memories are quite vague--perhaps I didn't read the whole thing, or else it just didn't stick with me. The only scene I vividly recalled when reading through it this time was when they accidentally tesser into a two-dimensional world. I remember that kind of freaking me out as a kid.<br /><br />Anyway, my overall impression of the book was just OK. The 3 Mrs.'s and Charles Wallace are all pretty good characters, but the rest didn't stand out too much to me. I found the morals of the book to be a little heavy-handed--probably to be expected for a kids' book, but I think for example Harry Potter handles things a little more subtly. But the message of "own and appreciate your quirks and don't try to be like other people" is a good one for kids (and adults).
