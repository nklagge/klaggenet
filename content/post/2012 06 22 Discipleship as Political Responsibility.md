As usual, I love anything Yoder writes. But only four stars because it doesn't cover any ground that I haven't already read about in "The Politics of Jesus" or "Body Politics." <br /><br />JHY is probably the clearest writer I have ever read. His arguments have very compelling, narrative-like logical structures, and yet you don't feel like you're reading academic work at all. Check out my previous reviews of the above-mentioned books if you want to know more about him.

My rating: 4 stars
