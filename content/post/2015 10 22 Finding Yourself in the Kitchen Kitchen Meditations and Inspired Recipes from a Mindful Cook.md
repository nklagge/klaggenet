Tough for me to rate this book. On the one hand, I love Dana Velden--one of my favorite food writers--and I think almost everything she wrote in the book is great. On the other hand, I'm not sure how well it works as a book.<br /><br />Probably like most other readers, I got to know Velden's writing through her "Weekend Meditation" blog posts. These are nice, fairly short, thoughtful sketches of ideas related to food and cooking--mostly the emotional or personal aspects, how these things fit into the broader setting of a life. Velden is a former Buddhist contemplative and it shows through in her writing, in the best way.<br /><br />FYK is basically a series of Weekend Meditations. I don't think any of them are actually recycled; I'm pretty sure it's all new material. There are some recipes scattered through the book, but they're really not the main focus. Velden makes a game attempt at imposing some structure on the book by organizing it into three sections on different types of intimacy, and I think that works OK. But in the end, these are still the Zen-like fragments that the Weekend Meditation was, and they seem more suited to being delivered in an unstructured way. I read the book cover-to-cover, but after I finished, that felt like the wrong way to read it, and I wished that DV had just published the contents as regular Weekend Meditation posts instead of as a book!<br /><br />Four stars for the content, but three stars for the book-as-book. Go check out her blog posts if you are interested.

My rating: 3 stars
