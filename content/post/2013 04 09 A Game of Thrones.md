I had mixed feelings about this book. Through the first half or so, I was really enjoying it. It's an entertaining read and there are some interesting characters, like Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow. However, in the second half of the book, two things happened. First, a major character was killed--under circumstances where that was a realistic outcome, granted, but knowing this character wasn't going to be around definitely reduced my appetite for the story. And second, it started to drag a bit--the book is nearly 700 pages long. I'm interested in watching the TV series now, but I can't say I feel that motivated to read the subsequent books in the series.
