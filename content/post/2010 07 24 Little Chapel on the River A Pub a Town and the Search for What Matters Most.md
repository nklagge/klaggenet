Elise and I read this book aloud together. We picked it up because my sister went totally crazy over it a couple of years ago, and we have been into reading things about community. It was very enjoyable and, as I alluded to in my review of "The Great Good Place", I think that perhaps narrative is a better medium through which to argue in favor of places like Guinan's than expository writing.<br /><br />Two regrets:<br /><br />-Guinan's closed in 2008, so we cannot go visit it.<br />-Elise would not do the Irish accent for Jim when she was reading :)
