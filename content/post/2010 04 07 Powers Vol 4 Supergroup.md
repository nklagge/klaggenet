Despite the high recommendation of a well-respected friend, I just never got into these books. I am not generally a comic book person but I did read and very much like Watchmen. The "Powers" books never seemed to achieve the same depth of character and plot that Watchmen did. My friend says that a lot of what's great about Powers is how the authors riff on the comic-book form, so that's something I definitely wouldn't have been able to appreciate.
