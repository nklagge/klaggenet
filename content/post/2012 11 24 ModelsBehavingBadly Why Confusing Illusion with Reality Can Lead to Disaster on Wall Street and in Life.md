I had somewhat high hopes for this book, but was pretty disappointed. Derman is all over the map, and makes a lot of superficial connections between things that don't really seem connected. It seemed to me more like he wanted to write a book than like he had a great idea that he decided to write a book about. I have his "Modeler's Hippocratic Oath" tacked up at my desk at work, but I'm afraid this book didn't do much to add to those few sentences.
