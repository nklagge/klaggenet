I read 45 books in 2012. This was fewer than the 65 I read in 2011, but the page count was closer as 2012 was dominated by a few very long books:

- *Joseph and His Brothers* by Thomas Mann, 1536 pages  
- *A History of the Federal Reserve* (Volume 1 and Volume 2 Book 1) by Allan Meltzer, 1504 pages  
- *1Q84* by Haruki Murakami, 945 pages  

I only had two 5-star ratings in 2012, for *Joseph and His Brothers* and for *An Everlasting Meal* by Tamar Adler.

The only two new books (2012 publication) that I read were *Why Nations Fail* by Acemoglu and Robinson, and *Twilight of the Elites* by Chris Hayes. Both of these were abetted by my acquisition this year of a (used, old model) Kindle, which I have used quite a bit for checking out e-books from the Brooklyn Public Library. Their selection is not stellar, but it is generally pretty good as far as new releases are concerned. (I also read *The Black Swan* and *Models Behaving Badly* on the Kindle, and Elise read *1Q84* on it--a relief for the wrists!) I definitely don't imagine I will move all or even most of my reading to the Kindle, but it is very nice to have for checking out e-books and for reading out-of-copyright books that are free.

The last notable book event of 2012 for me was my wild goose chase to find a copy of the out-of-print *Brewing and Beer Traditions in Norway*. This involved (a) trying to check it out of the New York Public Library, only to find when I got there that it was for in-library use only, (b) trying to find it in bookstores in Norway while I was there, and finally (c) successfully getting it on inter-library loan through NYU. And after all that, it was a pretty boring book!
