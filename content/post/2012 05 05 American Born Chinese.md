I actually first encountered GLY in flipping through another book of his, "Level Up," in a comic book shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia last year. After that, I found out that ABC is the book he's most famous for. Since then, every time we are somewhere with comic books, I would ask Elise, "What is the name of that guy who wrote Level Up?" Anyway, I finally took the opportunity of Free Comic Book Day to buy this little book and support my local comic book shop. It's a very enjoyable read and I LOL'd a couple of times while reading it. The structure reminded me a bit of "Sita Sings the Blues," a favorite movie of mine that also weaves together a modern-day story with a relevant folktale.
