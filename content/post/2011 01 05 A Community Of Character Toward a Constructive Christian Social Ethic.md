This book covers a lot of the same ground as "Truthfulness and Tragedy", Hauerwas's slightly earlier book of essays that I read late last year and loved. If I had read this book first, I'm sure I would have given it five stars as well. The most fun essay to read was the extended reflection on the role of narrative "scripture" in "Watership Down", which I managed to read between "Truthfulness and Tragedy" and this volume. It was also interesting to re-expose myself to Hauerwas's arguments after having read MacIntyre's "After Virtue", and to see how strong his influence on Hauerwas's thought is.

My rating: 4 stars
