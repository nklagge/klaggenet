Read this on the train to and from our backpacking trip this weekend, after Elise had enjoyed reading it a while back. I also liked it a lot--the folksy style reminds me of the "Grandfather Tales" and "Jack Tales" my dad read to my sister and me as kids. Tol Proudfoot is a very memorable character, and WB does a lot to make some fairly simple stories come alive. I especially liked the titular story, which hinted at a little more depth than the other ones. On the minus side, the book is ultra-conservative with respect to gender roles, which I know to expect from WB--but it doesn't mean I have to like it!

My rating: 4 stars
