This is a fun book that unfortunately is not generally available in the US (I had to get my mother-in-law get it for me in Manila). It's more or less a "bestiary" with entries for different monsters and creatures from Filipino folk traditions, including really nice (and sometimes freaky!) sketch-style illustrations. Each one includes a brief "blurb" from Pardo, the fictional monster-hunter.<br /><br />Having read Tan &amp; Baldisimo's "Trese" series, I was hoping for something a little more narrative. In fact, my favorite part of the book was the afterword, which creates a creepy frame story around the whole thing--I wish this had been a foreword, and would recommend reading it first if you pick up the book!<br /><br />I'd also like to know more about which regions and cultures of the Philippines the different legends come from, but I guess that will have to wait for the Maximo Ramos books that this draws on.

My rating: 3 stars
