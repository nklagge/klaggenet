I enjoyed this book, though I'm not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't already been interested in many of the characters. Though they are basically all logicians, philosophers, or mathematicians, the illustrator does a good job of making them into lively, colorful characters: the mad gardener Frege, the gaunt and intense Wittgenstein, the mechanical Godel.<br /><br />I agree with my dad that the frame story doesn't really help the book along, and the attempted connection to the Oresteia was pretty much beyond me. I wish the authors would have done what they discuss in the frame story, and continued the book to encompass the stories of John von Neumann and Alan Turing, who, I think they rightly indicate, represent the culmination of this story in many ways.

My rating: 3 stars
