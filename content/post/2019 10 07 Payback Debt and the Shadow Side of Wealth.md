I just happened upon this at a bookstore, and thought the intersection of author and topic was interesting enough to buy it. It's fairly engaging, kind of like a "lite" version of Graeber's "Debt," but I didn't feel like I learned that much by the end. I was interested in Atwood's discussion of millers historically being understood as dangerous in folklore--this was also the stance on millers in Le Guin's "Always Coming Home," and it had seemed like kind of a weird choice to me at the time.
