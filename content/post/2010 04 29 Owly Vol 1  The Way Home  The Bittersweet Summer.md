I borrowed the Owly books from Elise and, like her, I really enjoyed them. I read ("read") four in an afternoon. The stories are completely simple-minded and unflaggingly sweet, but somehow manage to convey some depth or import as well. In some sense the books are the apotheosis of "show don't tell" (since they are basically wordless), though sometimes that just results in the characters showing exaggerated emotion (lots of crying! but mostly happiness). Excited for the new Owly adventure on Free Comic Book Day (May 1)!
