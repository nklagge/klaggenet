Even more than "The Promise," I think this is the volume fans of the show are looking for--a conclusion to the unfinished story of Zuko's mother. Yang does a good job setting up tension between Zuko's desire not to be the son of a monster like Ozai, and the importance of that fact for his legitimacy as a ruler (although I feel like the agni kai rules of the Fire Nation should trump this question?). 

My rating: 4 stars
