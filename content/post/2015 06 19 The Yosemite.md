This was a pretty nice book and I pretty much love anything Muir writes. But, three stars because it is a compilation, and many of the sections I had read before elsewhere (or at least felt like I had). Unfortunately, his section on "what to do when you're in Yosemite" came late enough that I read it when we were almost done in Yosemite; fortunately, we did several of the things that he highlighted, including some of the not-so-famous stuff.

My rating: 3 stars
