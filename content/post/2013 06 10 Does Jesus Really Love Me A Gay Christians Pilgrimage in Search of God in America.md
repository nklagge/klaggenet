I was interested to read this as the author, Jeff Chu, is an acquaintance of mine from church. The intersection of homosexuality and Christianity is not an issue I have given a lot of thought to--although my best friend is gay, he is a non-observant Jew, and the congregations I have been a part of have been generally accepting of homosexuality and not really talked about it much. <br /><br />One of the main things I took away from this book is an impression of how beneficial the existence of the internet can be for a young person trying to come to terms with his or her homosexuality. Of course, it is unfortunate that the internet needs to play a leading role, as opposed to the person's friends and family themselves. But Jeff' interviewees repeatedly describe the experience of, one day, just typing "gay Christian" into a search engine. There are so many resources available, in stark contrast to maybe just 20 years ago when a young person, especially living in a small town, might have had almost nothing helping them. One of the organizations that comes off most positively from the book is the Gay Christian Network, GCN.<br /><br />When I once took a literary nonfiction writing class, one of the topics we discussed was how to insert yourself into your story "the right amount"--not maintaining the guise of some disinterested observer, but at the same time letting the story take the lead. I thought Jeff did a good job of this. He talks a fair amount about his personal story without making it "all about him," and also lets you know his own opinions on the different people and places he is profiling. I also liked the way that he integrated modern communication into the book by transcribing some conversations conducted by email, Twitter, or text message.

My rating: 4 stars
