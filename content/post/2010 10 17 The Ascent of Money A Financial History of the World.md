It was probably dumb of me to finish this book. As someone with a pretty strong background in finance, I found almost nothing new or interesting in this book. I had been hoping that a historian might bring an interesting perspective to the topic, but Ferguson covered his topics in a pretty standard way. I should have cut my losses and put it down earlier, but I kept hoping I would run across some new perspectives.

My rating: 2 stars
