I found this at the "friends of the Berkeley Public Library" book sale, and for $0.50, I couldn't say no. It's an out-of-print, hand-illustrated book from the '70s about some of the small parks in the East Bay near Berkeley. I'm familiar with most of them, but there were a few I hadn't visited. The book is, as the subtitle suggests, very much the author's personal thoughts and experiences with each of these parks. But I also learned some pretty interesting history! As much as I like it, I'll probably return it to the Berkeley used book circle of life so someone else can discover it!

My rating: 4 stars
