A pretty quick read as reading-cookbooks go. Good in that it is more about general principles than a collection of recipes. I'll reserve full judgment until Elise and I have made some liqueurs from its pages, but judging from the ones Laurel and Malcolm have made (we borrowed it from them) they are very good.

My rating: 3 stars
