This was a fun "TV book." Felicia Day is the co-creator, along with my man Wil Wheaton, of the YouTube board gaming show TableTop, of which I am a huge fan. Her story is pretty interesting--she had a weird upbringing but is also clearly some kind of genius, as she was both a very successful violinist and mathematician in college, then ended up creating a successful (as far as I can tell) company around geek stuff. But there is a lot of bad stuff in between, and she definitely doesn't pull the punches on it. I once tried watching her webseries "The Guild," which was kind of her breakout in the nerd world, and didn't like it. I'm not really inclined to try it again, but hearing her backstory definitely helped me understand where it came from a little more. I'll stick with TableTop though.

My rating: 3 stars
