A nice book-about-food that I read after Elise checked it out from the library. Elise and I are very lucky that we get to make and at lunch together at home almost every day now, so we're not exactly subjected to the standard rush and pressure around lunch that this book addresses. Nonetheless, I definitely appreciated the attitude of care that the author takes to even small touches. Reading this book even inspired me to try getting some small special foods once in a while (like fig jam) that we might use to complement our standard fare. That's saying a lot! <br /><br />One observation is that the author's cooking style is quite Euro-centric. That's fine, of course, but since reading the book, Elise and I have talked some about making Asian dishes in the author's style.
