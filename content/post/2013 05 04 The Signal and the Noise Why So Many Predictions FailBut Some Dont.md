It's been a while since I finished this book at this point, but I like it quite a bit. The only knock I have on it is not a real one; it's the same one I have with many popular-consumption books on topics that I have some level of expertise in: it's a popular-consumption book and doesn't get into the weeds as much as I'd like. But I can't really fault Nate Silver for not writing the book I wanted him to write.<br /><br />Mostly made me want to learn enough Bayesian modeling to use it in my work. Though I'm not sure how easy it would be to do that it an organization that wasn't focused on it overall.

My rating: 4 stars
