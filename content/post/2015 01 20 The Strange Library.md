This is really just a long short story. It was written by Murakami early in his career, but only translated into English now. I got a copy from the library and ready it in about an hour. The story has a lot of classic Murakami elements, including a sheep man. It was pretty enjoyable, with one moment that made me LOL, but nothing too amazing.
