I read this book because my grandma told me that she recognized in it many things from her own youth (though she did not grow up in Brooklyn or quite as early as Francie, the protagonist).<br /><br />This book struck me in very much the same way as "To Kill A Mockingbird." It is a good book, enjoyable to read, evocative of childhood and growing up; but also a book written for fairly young readers. That's not a knock on the book in any way--it's really important that there be good books for young readers! But I probably would have done better to read it in 8th grade than at age 26.
