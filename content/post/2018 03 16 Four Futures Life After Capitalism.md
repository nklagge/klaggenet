This is a short e-book expansion of Frase's "Four Futures" article from Jacobin:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/12/four-futures/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/12/fo...</a><br /><br />The book definitely does expand upon the article, but I'm not entirely sure it's for the better. There is more allusion to other thinkers and literature, but no real further elucidation of the core idea: exploration of different ways society might evolve in the face of very low-cost robotic production. I appreciate Frase's thought experiment, and especially the fact that he explicitly considers the role of the political system in determining the future. (And, a fortiori, that he is not giving a single projection, but rather a range of outcomes that will in part be determined by our collective behavior.) But I think you can get the main interesting ideas by reading the article.
