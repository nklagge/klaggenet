Nice book compiling some magazine articles on the Tolkien books from around when they came out, including several written by luminaries (CS Lewis, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. LeGuin). I mostly read this because it was a very short book I had hanging around that I hadn't read, and we're trying to get rid of most of our books before moving. It was definitely nice to be back in the world of Middle-Earth for a while, even at one remove. And although the writers have different perspectives, I found myself agreeing with each of them while I was reading them!
