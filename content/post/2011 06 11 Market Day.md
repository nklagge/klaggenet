I had high hopes for this based on a review, but only liked it so-so. It is artistically drawn, but the art didn't really catch my fancy. The story is low-key and sad. Although I can imagine others identifying with the protagonist, Mendleman (the artisan who has to decide between compromising his work and starving), I never did.
