Much like Roz Chast's excellent "Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?", this is a funny but also ultimately serious graphic novel about a serious topic: the author's experience of caring for her elderly and faltering grandparents on a cruise. I like Knisley ("Relish"), and the book has some LOL moments, but she also doesn't pull any punches for the sake of sentimentality.

My rating: 4 stars
