I got this a super long time ago, at City Lights bookstore when Elise and I visited San Francisco when we were first dating. We were doing a little spring cleaning of the bookshelves and I realized it was dumb of me to have carried around this slim volume for almost 7 years (!) without ever opening it. So I read through it, and well, it just didn't speak to me. I did however enjoy understanding most of the Tagalog words mixed in without having to read the occasional footnotes!
