I read 80 books this year according to Goodreads, and it will be 81 assuming I finish *Circe* in the next few days. This is a lot more than usual. I don't think my reading habits changed all that much this year; mostly I think the count is due to reading a lot of comic book volumes, which don't take very long to read. I did also spend some "extra" reading time reading *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* because I found it so compulsively readable. The count also doesn't include 4 Ursula Le Guin "Earthsea" books that I read, because they are part of a single illustrated volume that I still haven't finished.

By raw count, I achieved my goal of reading 50% works by women authors: 39 by men and 39 by women (counting *Circe*), with 3 neutral because of having basically balanced co-authorship. I would guess page count/reading time was also roughly balanced; although a lot of my male-authored books were comic book volumes, there was also *HPMOR*, which is like 2000 pages long.

There were 8 books that I rated 5-stars:
- *The Shadow Hero* by Gene Luen Yang  
- *The Parable of the Sower* by Octavia Butler  
- *The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet* by Becky Chambers  
- *Exhalation* by Ted Chiang  
- *How to Do Nothing* by Jenny Odell  
- *Always Coming Home* by Ursula Le Guin  
- *Ironheart Vol. 1* by Eve Ewing  
- *Cinderella Liberator* by Rebecca Solnit  

There were a few major projects that took up a lot of my reading this year: a bunch of Brian Michael Bendis Miles Morales Spider-Man comic collections I read after watching *Into the Spider-Verse*, *Always Coming Home*, and the aforementioned *HPMOR* and "Earthsea" volume. In addition to these, there were a few authors that I read more than one book by: Marjorie Liu ("Monstress" comics series), Octavia Butler, Rebecca Solnit, and Becky Chambers. A lot of crossover with my 5-star list, for obvious reasons.

I also started allowing myself to put down books that didn't grab me, and started a "did not finish" shelf on Goodreads for the first time. There were 5 books that I started and didn't finish this year (not included in the above counts). I probably didn't read more than 50 pages of each of them.

Finally, although I remain a huge library user, I started feeling a little more willing to buy books, mostly as a way to support some small bookstores that I like. I've started to appreciate them a lot more since moving to Hartford, which doesn't have great bookstores the way New York does. I still try to pass them on once I've finished, but have enjoyed doing this. My rule is to buy a book from a bookstore if I encounter something interesting browsing that I don't think I'd have found otherwise. This year, this included *How Long Til Black Future Month* (The Strand, NYC), *Intruders* (Book Lounge, Cape Town), *Knowledge and Pacification* (Arkipelago Books, San Francisco), *Ironheart Vol. 1* (bought as single comics at Galaxy Comics, NYC), *Trick Mirror* (Greenlight Books, NYC), *Payback* (Books are Magic, NYC), and *Ghost Wall* (Longfellow Books, Portland ME).
