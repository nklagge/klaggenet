Ellison Smyth (along with his wife Mary Linda) was a dear friend of my family when I was a kid. Our grandparents lived pretty far away, and the two of them were very much like surrogate grandparents to me and my sister. We spent many weekend or summer afternoons walking through the woods with them or hanging out at their house. To me they are an inspirational example of aging at its best--both were full of curiosity, kindness, and wisdom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, given all of that, I wasn't a big fan of this little book of reminiscences by Ellison. I'm glad I read it because it brought his presence back to me, but I wouldn't really recommend it for anyone who didn't know him personally.
