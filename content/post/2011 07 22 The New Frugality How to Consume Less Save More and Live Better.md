I found this among one of the ever-exciting Park Slope book piles (a much more frugal method of acquisition than paying $24, I might add), but found it pretty disappointing. There's nothing wrong with Farrell's financial advice, but I found almost nothing that I'd really consider original ideas. I guess it made me feel good that I mostly conduct my financial life in the way Farrell supports, but I would have been pretty annoyed if I had actually paid $24 for the book.
