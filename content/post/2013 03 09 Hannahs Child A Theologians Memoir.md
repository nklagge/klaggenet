Pretty enjoyable. Not an autobiography, but more of a set of focused and somewhat chronological musings on aspects of Hauerwas's life. One of the main aspects he emphasizes is the role of chance and contingency in his life, which is consistent with his religious writing and which is refreshing to hear from a person who has achieved great public success. His recounting of life with his manic-depressive ex-wife was quite sobering; I have to say that I entered the book with some interest in reading about that topic, but actually reading it was no fun at all.

My rating: 3 stars
