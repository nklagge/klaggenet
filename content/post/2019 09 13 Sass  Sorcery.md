I think it would be great fun to play a D&amp;D campaign as the Rat Queens. (If I had first pick I think I would play as Vi Blackforge.) This collection is clever and creative, playing with RPG tropes without being too lampshadey or breaking fourth walls. There is a lot of pretty graphic violence, but it is mostly in the spirit of fun--not exploitative feeling, or played for grimness at all. The characters and style are very memorable, although the plot feels like very much a second priority. I also appreciated that the story had four female protagonists, who definitely have sexual interests but are not (to my eye) particularly drawn for the male gaze.
