I haven't done this in a couple of years, and I'm not really interested in keeping up the kind of general statistical analysis that I did in some previous years. However, I wanted to mention one thing that is both retrospective and forward-looking. The writer Robert Wringham, whom I like a lot, mentioned in his [2015 reading retrospective](http://newescapologist.co.uk/2015/12/31/an-escapologists-diary-part-46-2015-review/) that he is trying to read more books written by women, and that indeed over half the books he read in 2015 had female authors.

I was curious how my own reading would stack up on that front, without my having given it any conscious thought. Looking through my 2015 Goodreads list, I count about 1/3 of the books I read as having female authors. (It's not always 100% clear; I counted co-authored books and edited collections as 50% female unless all of the contributors were of a single gender, but the count of these is in any case fairly small.) I think the actual situation is even worse than that number would suggest, though. A fairly high number of the female-authored books I read were cookbooks (Dana Velden, Heidi Swanson, Edna Lewis), and that is not an area where female authors are generally under-represented or under-appreciated.

So I am setting as a 2016 objective that at least half of the books I read will be by female authors. I think it will be an interesting experience. I am off to a good start, with my first book of the year being *The Lathe of Heaven* by Ursula K. Le Guin, as well as two other female-authored books being very high on my reading list (*Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel and *The Tale of Genji* by Murasaki Shikibu).

On a separate note, my five-star-rated books of 2015:
- *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up* by Marie Kondo  
- *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline  
- *On the Shortness of Life* by Seneca  
- *The Martian* by Andy Weir  
- *My First Summer in the Sierra* by John Muir
