I really enjoyed this book. Lahiri's writing is powerful without feeling overwritten, and the stories are achingly understated--there is so much left unsaid that you can feel coursing under the surface. They are often sad, but not so much that you finish thinking "That was a sad story." "UE" lived up to the expectations set by "The Namesake." Tough to pick a favorite story, but I think the titular "Unaccustomed Earth" and "Only Goodness" tie for first place.

My rating: 4 stars
