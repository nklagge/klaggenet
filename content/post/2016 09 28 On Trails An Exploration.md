This book was enjoyable, but felt at times like it was trying a little too hard to be a Non-Fiction Book. It covers many different topics relating to the general idea of "trails", including research on very ancient fossils, identification of old Native American trails in the southern USA, and the development of the International Appalachian Trail. Moor can be an engaging writer, but sometimes this comprehensiveness feels a bit plodding or dutiful. I felt like I would rather have read one or more articles by him on the topic, rather than a whole book. (Perhaps it is my fault for dutifully plodding through the book!) The most interesting part for me was reading about the IAT, something I had never heard of before, despite a reasonable amount of knowledge about the AT.
