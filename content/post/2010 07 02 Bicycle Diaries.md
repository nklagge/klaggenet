I was pretty unimpressed by this book. It is divided into chapters on various cities around the world and the New York chapter is the only one I really found interesting. That may be partially because I live in NYC, but also it's the only chapter that really focuses on cycling. Most of the other chapters are just Byrne's digressions into whatever he wants to talk about. This was especially disappointing for the Manila chapter, since I visited that city around the time I was reading the book.<br /><br />I'd recommend skipping the book; if you're a New Yorker, it might be worth your time to read Byrne's WSJ article on this same topic, which condenses most of his interesting comments from the NYC chapter into a shorter piece:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574403293064136098.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001...</a>
