A fine book (pamphlet, almost), which touches on many of the themes Addams addresses in "Twenty Years at Hull-House." But without the focus on specific individuals and stories, the arguments lose some of their timeless quality. I can see why this book is not as widely read today as TYHH.

My rating: 3 stars
