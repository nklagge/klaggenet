As with all of my very favorite books, it's difficult for me to put into words what "Twenty Years at Hull-House" meant to me. <br /><br />Although I am not generally a big annotator, I was kicking myself for checking this out of the library and not having bought my own copy so that I couldn't underline, write notes, etc. At the same time, I couldn't keep myself from reading it until I bought a copy. All in all this was not too upsetting, because I definitely intend to read this book again in the future, probably more than once.<br /><br />The clearest thing that I can say is that Jane Addams is the first historical figure I have ever encountered who I really consider to be a role model. There are plenty of historical figures who I admire, respect, or even look up to, but what makes JA different for me is that I see in her the best possible version of my own type of character. She is someone who I feel I can truly aspire to be like because to be like her wouldn't require any fundamental changes to my values, beliefs, or circumstances; only to make the most of them. When I read her writing, on nearly every subject, I find myself both agreeing and feeling like she is expanding my understanding, sort of like talking to a good friend.<br /><br />I would strongly encourage anyone to read this book. It's actually old enough that it's in the public domain and available for free online (<a target="_blank" href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/addams/hullhouse/hullhouse.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://digital.library.upenn.edu/wome...</a>), but I'll warn you that you might wish you had a margin to take notes in. I'd also encourage reading the entry on her in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy online, which was the first place where I really encountered her (<a target="_blank" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/addams-jane/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/add...</a>).<br /><br />She speaks much more eloquently for herself, but I'll give a little description of what I find so compelling here. She lived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and founded a "settlement" called Hull-House in the immigrant slums of Chicago. It's not easy to give a concise definition of a settlement, because part of what's important is that it be multifarious and always open to experimentation, but at its most basic the idea is that it is a place where people from privileged backgrounds live in an underprivileged neighborhood, hopefully to the benefit of both. Hull-House was a center for all sorts of social, intellectual, and artistic programs, really an innovator in many things that have today the government has taken on. <br /><br />I like JA for her pragmatism. She spends a fair amount of time in the book talking about Tolstoy, who took a much more extreme position on poverty (and walked the walk), but ends up finding herself parting ways with him. I also like her for her commitment to applied work. In some ways this may have been forced on her by cultural circumstances (being a woman in the early twentieth century), but I also think it's an important part of her character. As the SEP article shows, she was an accomplished philosopher in her own right, as creative a thinker as her friend John Dewey (for example). In my opinion she walked the perfect line between intellectual and practitioner. <br /><br />Aside from my deep admiration for JA herself, I also took away from this book an interesting perspective on American history. Much of her writing on social issues seemed almost shockingly modern to me in its concerns--for instance the passages on public education. She also spends a significant amount of time writing about Abraham Lincoln, who was a major intellectual and character influence on her, and this section drew for me a sense of continuity from Lincoln and abolitionism through the Progressive era that I had never seen or thought about before.
