Has the qualities of cookbooks that I like: no photographs, hand-drawn pictures, and enough non-recipe text that you can "read" it cover-to-cover...which I did. I like that this book has fairly substantial sections on both gardening and preserving, but given everything that it is trying to squeeze in, it's not a replacement for dedicated books on those topics.

My rating: 3 stars
