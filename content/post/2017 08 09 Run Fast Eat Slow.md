Elise checked this book out of the library after a runner friend of ours made and shared with us two recipes from it--a salad, and the sweet potato cookies--both of which were great! We haven't ourselves made any recipes from it yet (besides a very good salad dressing), but the philosophy of the authors is very similar to ours (emphasis on whole foods and variety, as opposed to quantitative balancing of macronutrients. A lot of the recipes look like things we already would have made, but I'm also looking forward to trying some new ones!

My rating: 4 stars
