Very good, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Philippines--particularly Americans who, like me, haven't had much exposure to the history of the country. Although this book does focus on the relationship between the Philippines and America, it's a pretty comprehensive history of the country, from the arrival of Magellan through Cory Aquino. Karnow is a good storyteller and, I think, a fairly objective historian. I was kind of hoping to find in this book some Filipino heroes to look up to, and while there are certainly some good people, no one is put on a pedestal, even Karnow's personal friend Ninoy Aquino. I was somewhat reminded, in reading this, of the history of Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic--a smallish country that is often outside the grand stage of world affairs, but often gets buffeted about by what is happening there, and occasionally gets drawn onstage for a few minutes as well.

My rating: 4 stars
