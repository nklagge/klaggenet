{{% epigraph pre="Evan Williams, “The Possibility of an Ongoing Moral Catastrophe” (2015)" %}}We should regard intellectual progress, of the sort that will allow us to find and correct our moral mistakes as soon as possible, as an urgent moral priority rather than as a mere luxury.{{% /epigraph %}}

{{% newthought %}}Most human societies have had horrific moral blind spots.{{% /newthought %}} Since our present society is just one of hundreds over time, it's unlikely that we would be the first society not to have any. Thus, it's probable that our society has one or more horrific moral blind spot--an argument from induction. Moreover, even if we correctly believe it's highly likely that we're morally correct in each of our current moral beliefs individually, there are so many areas where we could be wrong that there's a high probability that we are wrong about at least one of them--an argument from disjunction.

So argues philosophy professor Evan Williams in his 2015 paper "The Possibility of an Ongoing Moral Catastrophe.”{{% sidenote %}}[Williams, Evan G. "The possibility of an ongoing moral catastrophe." *Ethical theory and moral practice* 18.5 (2015): 971-982.](https://philpapers.org/archive/WILTPO-101.pdf/){{% /sidenote %}} I'm not sure how I first encountered this paper, but it made a strong impression on me through its simple and compelling argument, and I think about it often. Without advancing any specific judgment, Williams cites a number of examples of things that could potentially qualify as current moral catastrophes, including mass incarceration, factory farming, and abortion. I believe there's a pretty good case for more than one current moral catastrophe, but I think the power of Williams's argument lies in the fact that it holds regardless of your views on any specific issue. 

Given this probabilistic conclusion, what should we do? Williams argues, in line with the epigraph above, that we ought to structure our society in ways that make it likely for us to recognize wrongdoing quickly, and to be flexible enough to change our actions to reflect improved values once we do identify a specific case of wrongdoing--both in terms of resources and in terms of our political decision-making apparatus. He discusses various concrete ways in which a society could be better or worse at either of these tasks, but I was particularly intrigued by one of the references in his footnotes.

Professor Allen Buchanan's 2002 paper "Social Moral Epistemology"{{% sidenote %}}[Buchanan, Allen. "Social moral epistemology." *Social philosophy & policy* 19.2 (2002): 126-152.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/social-moral-epistemology/ACD1E6C3CC9E0CBB254ECA18CBDEB941){{% /sidenote %}} is a more in-depth look at this specific challenge: how do social practices and institutions of any given society promote or impede the formation of true beliefs that cultivate right moral action and condemn wrong moral action? The whole paper is extremely interesting (and, like the Williams paper, quite readable), but the general idea is that the standard "reflective equilibrium" method of applied ethics, where we try to arrive at a set of moral principles that best align with our intuitions about right and wrong, has a fatal flaw if we live in societies that systematically distort our moral intuitions. Thus, says Buchanan, we should study what circumstances are likely to produce such distortions.

Although the paper is just a sketch,{{% marginnote %}}The late great David Graeber makes a similar argument in ["Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology"](http://www.abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf): "[V]iolence, particularly structural violence, where all the power is on one side, creates ignorance. If you have the power to hit people over the head whenever you want, you don't have to trouble yourself too much figuring out what they think is going on, and therefore, generally speaking, you don't" (72).{{% /marginnote %}} Buchanan identifies that individuals with high status and privilege are systematically vulnerable to moral epistemic vices, such as self-serving rationalization and expertise imperialism. As such, he comments, a developed social moral epistemology would lend support to "the view of critical race theorists and feminist social epistemologists that individuals who occupy positions of subordination in racist or sexist social orders are epistemically privileged" (146). 

{{% newthought %}}I probably don't need to spell it out,{{% /newthought %}} but American society in 2020 seems like a dismal failure from the perspective of social moral epistemology. In addition to the proliferation of misinformation on social media, and the undercutting of scientific expertise, our social practices and institutions systematically exclude the voices of people in positions of subordination. This is probably most clearly evident in the *Citizens United* Supreme Court decision that equated money with speech, ensuring that the most economically privileged in our society would have the loudest political voices as well. But it's just as evident in the systemic racism, and in particular anti-Black racism, that results in underrepresentation of people of color in positions of political, economic, and media power. And as many have commented recently, our political structures are extremely resistant to change.

Nonetheless, I see some reasons for hope. The 1619 Project, the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements have all been extremely impactful in our national discourse, and the papers I mentioned above allow me to see them as united by more than just being positive social justice movements:{{% marginnote %}}This lens also helped me reframe my thinking on reading more women and authors of color: it's about learning from their privileged moral positions as much as it is about getting them more sales.{{% /marginnote %}} they are movements that improve our social moral epistemology by specifically amplifying the voices of marginalized populations. I also found reasons for hope in two books I read recently: *Caste* by Isabel Wilkerson, and *From Here to Equality* by William (Sandy) Darity and Kirsten Mullen--not just because they are well-publicized books by Black authors addressing the ongoing moral catastrophe of white supremacy and anti-Black racism, but also because I think each of them offers a new "technology" for improving our society's moral knowledge.
