A really fun and heartfelt story about the basketball team at the high school where Yang formerly taught. GLY does a good job portraying the individual players, their hopes and struggles, as well as dramatizing the excitement of a basketball game on the page. I felt the interweaving of Yang's own career decisions, and some of the other "meta" parts of the book, didn't work as well, but also didn't detract too much from the main story.
