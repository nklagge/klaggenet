The blurb on the front says, "Gentrification horror at its finest." I can't disagree with this, but it makes me wonder, is "gentrification horror" a subgenre that predated "BTTM FDRS"? If so, I definitely would like to read other examples! <br /><br />I thought this book did a great job of taking on some of the complex issues around gentrification without coming across a preachy. Mostly, I think it achieved this by just being weird as hell and sticking to its guns. Passmore's art is very distinctive, with more or less realist line drawings saturated in wild and varying bright colors. The illustrations of the "thing" in the building reminded me a little of the gonzo quasi-gross-out art of the game "Epic Spell Wars."<br /><br />"Goddamn duck-snake hybrids!"
