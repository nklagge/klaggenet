I remain a devotee of Hauerwas, but I was quite disappointed in this book. Maybe I should chalk it up to having binged on religious books lately. I in fact had decided to go back to secular books for a while before reading this, but the pastor of my new church mentioned to me that he had read this recently and liked it. I guess he found something in it that I didn't. Unlike other books of Hauerwas's that I've enjoyed ("Truthfulness and Tragedy," "A Community of Character," "The Peaceable Kingdom," "Resident Aliens") this book seemed completely devoid of a unifying theme, and really came across as "a book of essays I haven't published anywhere else yet." Being Hauerwas, of course, there were still some great moments--"Why Time Cannot and Should Not Heal The Wounds of History" in particular struck me as quite insightful. <br /><br />Time to read some secular books for a while.
