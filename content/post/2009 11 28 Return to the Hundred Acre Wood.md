I read these new Pooh stories while I was home on Thanksgiving break. I laughed out loud more than once. My favorite story was the one with the spelling bee--I think I sympathize with Wol in some ways. It's been a long time since I've been exposed to the other Pooh stories, but my sense was that these are a worthy follow-up. Reading this also made me realize that I've never read the original Pooh books, only had them read to me. And that it is very fun to read Pooh books out loud.
