Listened to as an audiobook on a cross-country plane ride. I really enjoy WW as an audiobook reader. He does a good job (both as author and reader) of setting an atmosphere, and the story has a satisfying symmetry to it. I did wish for a little more in-universe lore about the monster. Perhaps a sequel?
