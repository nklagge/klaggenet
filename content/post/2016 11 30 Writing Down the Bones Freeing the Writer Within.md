This was a fun "TV book" for me. I am not exactly interested in "freeing the writer within" me, but Elise had been reading it and read a couple of nice passages out loud to me. The book is a little bit like Dana Velden's cookbook; a little bit Zen, but mostly very applied (to a different discipline in each case). The main concept that stuck with me was the importance of doing without too much worry about the quality of the product ("done is better than perfect", one might say), but also the idea of doing this only with a sense of desire, rather than mere dutifulness. This is a bit paradoxical, as I guess much Zen wisdom is. Dutifulness is something I can struggle with sometimes!
