As with any collection of essays, I enjoyed these to varying degrees--but the best ones were very good. I wasn't so into the ones more narrowly focused on writing and being a writer--perhaps I am just not the target audience. I really enjoyed the essay on the tarot, and the closing essay "On Becoming an American Writer." I also appreciated reading about his experiences as an AIDS activist in San Francisco--a place/time and issue that I don't know enough about.
