I'm still enjoying this series, but this felt like a step down from Vol. 2 ("The Blood"). The shielded city of Pontus is just not as fun of a setting as the pirate city of Thyria and the Isle of Bones (duh). The art is still great, the plot is still a little hard to keep track of, but I thought the sense of wonder and learning about new things subsided a bit. I did like Kippa going off on her own to help the refugee fox people; I hope that's the start of a plotline that develops her into something more than Maika's kawaii sidekick.
