I enjoyed reading this out loud with Elise (though reading a recipe aloud is a bit of an odd experience!). While I always appreciate Tamar Adler, though, this book didn't inspire the way that "An Everlasting Meal" did. That's a pretty high bar, though, seeing as how AEM is probably my (and definitely Elise's) favorite cookbook of all time! 

My rating: 3 stars
