An excellent graphic novel version of the original, which I got my Dad for Christmas--snuck a read in myself while I was home. The illustrations are as cool as you might imagine given that the artists come from drawing "real" comic books like X-Men. The story here hews much more closely to the book than to the movie.

My rating: 4 stars
