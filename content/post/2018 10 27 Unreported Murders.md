Reading this volume last out of the six, I can confirm that the series hits its stride in #3, "Mass Murders." The stories here, as in #1, are very episodic and don't build the character of Trese or the overarching plot very much. Also, I was definitely disappointed that Case #7 turns out to be an anti-abortion story. It's a natural place to go with the tiyanak (a mythological evil spirit that is spawned when an unwanted child is left to die), but there are plenty of other ways the story could have been done!
