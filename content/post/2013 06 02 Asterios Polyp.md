Bingo, this was the graphic novel I was waiting for! A very simple story when it comes down to it, with a small number of characters, each memorable. Asterios himself is a deeply flawed character that I, and I suspect most readers of this book, nonetheless felt some connection with. Beautiful illustrations too, even (or especially) in a pared-down color palette.
