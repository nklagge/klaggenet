As someone from Appalachia who's into DIY stuff, I'm surprised it took me this long to read this book. (Especially since my dad has all of them sitting on his bookshelves.) I loved it, of course. It is in significant part a practical book covering topics ranging from building a log cabin to pickling vegetables, and initially, I felt most excited about learning those things. But although that was cool, it wasn't what really got me about the book. What really got me was being re-connected to an Appalachian culture that I was lucky enough to have a little connection to when I was a kid, through friends of the family, Ellison and Mary Linda Smyth. The difference extends beyond the crafts and activities. Nature looms large, money plays a different role, people are more tied to places. I think one can get something of value from Foxfire without needing to embrace a back-to-the-land-ism or a romanticized notion of country life (indeed, Foxfire would definitely disabuse you of the latter, though it might kindle the former).<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed was the strong "high school" voice that came through in the writing--an exuberance, a teetering balance of confidence and self-consciousness. <br /><br />Loved the chapter on moonshining, which made me want to build a still. It's really not that complicated, especially if you're already brewing beer...

My rating: 4 stars
