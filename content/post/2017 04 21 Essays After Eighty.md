Didn't love it, especially after the much better "Eagle Pond." Hall is a good prose stylist, but can come across as rather self-satisfied. This is balanced in EP by the fact that he is mostly writing about other people and a place, but in EAE his topic is more or less himself. As the saying goes, as people age, they become themselves, only more so. "A House Without A Door" was my favorite of the collection.
