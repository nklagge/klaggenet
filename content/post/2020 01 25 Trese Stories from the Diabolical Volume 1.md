This is a nice little addition for the Trese completionist, but I wouldn't really recommend it for anyone else--not least because it's difficult to get a hold of (I could only find it in the Philippines). I like the concept a lot, of a set of stories told by Hank, the bartender at Alexandra Trese's base The Diabolical. I liked that Tan wove the stories into the Trese universe so that some of them intersected briefly with stories from the main volumes. But, at the end of the day, this is pretty different from the main volumes. It's not really a graphic novel, more a set of stories with illustrations. And the stories are not as fleshed out or complex as the ones in the main volumes.
