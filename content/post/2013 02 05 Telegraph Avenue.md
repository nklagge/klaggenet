I was a little hesitant to read this book because I was sure it wouldn't live up to the quality of Kavalier &amp; Clay, and I was right. TA is a very nice novel and I enjoyed reading it, but it lacked that special quality that K&amp;C had. My experience of reading TA was much like my experience of reading "The Fortress of Solitude"--the characters and story are interesting, but I didn't come to care deeply about them.
