Recommended to me by a friend who has been using its recipes for kimchi and sauerkraut. It's the kind of cookbook you can easily "read," which I always enjoy. The author seems like an interesting guy; he has a certain hippie affinity with the author of "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers," but tempered with just a little more down-to-earthness. I am currently using his recipe for "Fruit Scrap Vinegar" to try to make apple cider vinegar out of a bunch of saved apple cores. The jury's out until it's done, but it's definitely fermenting away!

My rating: 3 stars
