I read 53 books in 2017. That's about average for me since I've kept track on Goodreads.

I rated 8 books five-stars:
- *Pachinko*, by Min Jin Lee  
- *The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye*, by Sonny Liew (and OMG, Sonny "liked" my review!)  
- *The Fifth Season* and *The Stone Sky*, by N.K. Jemisin  
- *Stories of Your Life and Others*, by Ted Chiang  
- *Player's Handbook* (for 5th Edition D&D)  
- *Letter on Ethics*, by Seneca  
- *House of Debt*, Atif Mian and Amir Sufi  

In particular, the "Broken Earth" trilogy by N.K. Jemisin (the two above plus *The Obelisk Gate*, which I only gave four stars) really rekindled my faith in fantasy as a genre that can tell fresh and important stories. I also got to see Min Jin Lee and N.K. Jemisin speak at events!

After making a concerted (and successful) effort to read 50% women authors in 2016, I didn't keep that as a goal for 2017, and boy did I fall miserably low. I think my 2017 reading was only about 25% women or so. But three of my 5-star books were by women!

I thought it would be interesting to try to group my reading into categories and see where my emphasis was. I don't think any of the results are too surprising. I was a little surprised to see that I only read one grown-up non-graphic novel outside of sci-fi and fantasy (which was *Pachinko*, one of my favorite books of the year!).
