Along with "Severance," maybe not a great book to read during a pandemic? Although the cataclysm in "Weather" is much more allusive. I had a weird mix of not being super into this book, but also finishing it in one night. (I have a lot of spare time during social distancing...) Offill is a sharp and engaging writer, but ultimately I would say the book didn't have a big impact on me. The book is written in a distinctive style, which reminded me a lot of Rachel Cusk's "Outline," but more disjointed. I appreciate what both authors are trying to do, I think I just like a more traditional structure.

My rating: 3 stars
