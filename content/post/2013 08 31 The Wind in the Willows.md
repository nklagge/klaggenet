This was a fun read that I picked up after Elise enjoyed it, though I had to remove it from my "read aloud" shelf since we only read the first chapter together. I agreed with her that the first chapter, about the Mole and Rate having a picnic together, is really the nicest part of the book, but there were other highlights too, such as the chapter when Mole and Rat go back to Mole's old home and host some Christmas-caroling mice. I also think I enjoyed the character of Mr. Toad a little more than Elise did, including at least one part that made me LOL and that still does so sometimes when I think of it.
