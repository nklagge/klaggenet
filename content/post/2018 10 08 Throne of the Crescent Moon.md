I had heard about this book as a good example of non-Eurocentric fantasy--free of elves, orcs, and the general weight of the dead hand of Tolkien. The setting is an imaginary kingdom, but is clearly Middle-Eastern in style and influenced by the content and imagery of the Thousand and One Nights tales. I appreciated how Ahmed foregrounded some fantasy concepts that are actually Middle Eastern in origin, despite the fact that they have been adopted into the European fantasy milieu--such as ghouls and alchemists (ghuls and alkhemists). The plot and characters were at least as good as "The Name of The Wind," which I feel like was way more hyped. I guess partly inspired by this book, I've recently gotten interested in learning more about Filipino mythology and folklore. The world contains so many fascinating folkloric traditions, and it's a shame that fantasy literature (at least in English) draws so heavily on a tiny slice of them!
