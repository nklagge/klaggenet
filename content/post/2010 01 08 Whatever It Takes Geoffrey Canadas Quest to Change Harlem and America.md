Another book in my whirlwind quest to read a ton of stuff about urban education and school leadership. If you haven't heard of Geoffrey Canada and the Harlem Children's Zone, you're really missing out on an amazing story. Best of all, the book is also written very well, and makes for a pretty gripping read. I'd pretty much recommend it to anyone who lives in a city and/or has a social conscience.
