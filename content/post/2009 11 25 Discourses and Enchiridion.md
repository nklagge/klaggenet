A much better expression of Stoic ideas than "Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius." Epictetus (or his student Arrian) seems to be a more focused thinker than M.A., whose book really does just read like a scattershot collection of his thoughts. The Enchiridion and The Discourses cover pretty much the same material, with the former basically a condensed version of the latter. If you are interested in Stoic philosophy, I would recommend starting with the Enchiridion, then if you like it moving on to The Discourses. Marcus Aurelius is OK but I'd probably recommend Cicero over him.<br /><br />The school of thought is simple to understand but a challenge to put into practice. Although I'm not sure I'm with Epictetus on everything, he definitely has some compelling insights. This is a book that I imagine I'll definitely come back to over the years.

My rating: 4 stars
