GLY is one of my favorite graphic novel writers, and this one was very enjoyable. I had seen it a long time ago, but thought of it recently because I had just read "Ready Player One" and was thinking about video games, I guess. The book turned out not to revolve around video games quite as much as I had expected, but that was OK. <br /><br />For anyone who hadn't read GLY before, I would still recommend starting with either "American Born Chinese" or "Boxers &amp; Saints." Both of those books have a little bit more of the extended flights of fantasy that, for me, are the most enjoyable part of his work.

My rating: 3 stars
