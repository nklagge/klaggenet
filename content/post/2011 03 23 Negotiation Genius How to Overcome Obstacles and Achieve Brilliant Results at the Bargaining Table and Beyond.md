This book was assigned for my grad school class on negotiation and conflict management. Although my reading of it was drawn out over half a semester, this book would be readable in a couple of hours. It was a fairly entertaining read and I think it had some useful instruction, though I haven't had a chance to test it out in any real scenarios. Although the title is "Negotiation Genius," I mostly feel like having read it will help me not be a negotiation idiot.
