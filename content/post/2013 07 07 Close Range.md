Read in Montana over our honeymoon, and left behind in Granite Park Chalet to save backpack weight after I finished. Pretty enjoyable overall. Proulx's writing is nicely understated for the most part, with a couple of exceptions. I most enjoyed the first and last stories ("Half-Skinned Steer" and the well-known "Brokeback Mountain").
