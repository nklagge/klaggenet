I enjoyed reading this, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to most others. I got interested in it after reading Yudkowsky's excellent "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality." Like HPMOR, this book is excessively long, and pretty readable. (It was a great book to have on my e-reader on an international trip.) But, it's more or less just a loosely organized collection of blog posts. As such, although I enjoyed it while reading it, my recall of its content a couple of months later is fairly limited. HPMOR touches on basically the same themes, but in a much more structured and engaging (and therefore memorable!) way. 

My rating: 3 stars
