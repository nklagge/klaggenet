Ultimately, I don't think I liked the book as much as I was expecting to based on the personal recommendations I got. O'Neill's writing style is not one that I especially enjoy. He seems to be always on the lookout for a fresh, creative turn of phrase, with the result that, in my mind, the writing receives more attention than the story. None of these characters are ones that will really stick with me, even the nominally interesting Chuck Ramkissoon. Still, the overall story is pretty nice--just not exactly my own cup of tea.
