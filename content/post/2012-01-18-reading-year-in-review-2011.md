I read 65 books in 2011.

My average rating for books was 3.29, while the average Goodreads rating for those same books was 3.91. I gave my first 1-star review (*The Character of Rain*), but I also gave quite a few five-star reviews (the three *Hunger Games* books, *Body Politics*, *Christ and the Powers*, *Strength to Love*, *Loaves and Fishes*, and *Wittgenstein in Exile*). As you can see, most of my five-star books were religious books. I think this comes from my criterion for a five-star book, which is that it has to feel like it has some lasting impact on my perspective--more likely with a religious book (for me).

I read more than one book by a number of authors: Suzanne Collins, Stanley Hauerwas, Bill McKibben, Haruki Murakami, Eliot Wigginton, John Howard Yoder.

The longest book I read was Colin Fletcher's *The Complete Walker* (864 pages).

As in 2010, I read relatively few books that might be considered "novels" (about 10-11) and relatively few books by women (9). I did, however, read significantly more books in translation (12). I also read three new books (published in 2011): *Owly and Wormy Friends All Aflutter*, *The Great Stagnation*, and *Debt: The First 5000 Years*.

My method-of-acquisition distribution was a bit more balanced in 2011:

- Library - 22  
- Borrowed - 20  
- Bought - 13  
- Gift - 8  
- Free Box - 2  

My dad noted in his 2011 reading review that he sees buying books from independent bookstores as supporting a good cause. I agree with this to some extent, but I also place value on cultivating non-market, collective and social spheres of existence, and I think reliance on the library and borrowing/lending with friends (and free-box giving/taking!) grow out of that.
