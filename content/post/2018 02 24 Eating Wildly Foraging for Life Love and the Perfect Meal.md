This was a fun read that I mostly finished on a long plane ride. I remember reading Chin's "Urban Forager" column in the NY Times several years ago. The book combines stories about here experience as an urban forager with stories about family (her relationship with her parents and grandparents) and her own search for a good partner. At times I felt like she tried to draw parallels a little too strongly, but mostly I thought it worked. And after reading her extensive discussion of reishi mushrooms, I just saw one in the farmers' market today!
