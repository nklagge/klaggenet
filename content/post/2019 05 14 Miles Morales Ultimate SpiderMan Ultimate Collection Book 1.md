I picked this book up because I loved the "Into the Spider-Verse" movie that came out earlier this year. For those who don't know, Miles Morales is an alternate-universe Spider-Man who is an Afro-Latino kid from Brooklyn rather than a white kid from Queens. This volume covers much of the same basic territory as the 2019 movie--though, in keeping with the theme of the movie, it is sort of an "alternate-universe" version of the same story. We get the origin story of Miles Morales, the death of Peter Parker in Miles's universe, and a crossover story where Morales teams up with the alternate universe's (living) Peter Parker. But there are some subtle differences, which for me break in both directions. The book does a much better job building up to Miles being bitten by a mutant spider, which in the movie just seems to be a totally random event. In addition, the book's explanation of the mutant spider also clearly explains why Miles has spider-powers that are somewhat similar and somewhat different from Peter Parker's, which is just presented as fact in the movie. Finally, Miles's roommate Ganke is a much bigger part of the book, and he is a great character. On the other hand, I thought the movie did a much better job of handling the character of Miles's Uncle Aaron/The Prowler. The movie portrays him as a flawed but redeemable man who has gotten mixed up in some dirty business. In the book, he is a much less empathetic character who is more or less irredeemably cruel to Miles once he finds out his secret identity. I was also disappointed that the book didn't feature Miles speaking Spanish with his mom (who is basically a non-entity in the book), which I thought was a nice touch in the movie (particularly the choice not to include subtitles).<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man, and am looking forward to reading some of the further volumes. He's a well-written character with more interesting family and personal relationships than Peter Parker. I like that he has different powers, although I was a little disappointed that he ultimately gets Peter Parker's web-shooters, which basically results in him having all of the basic Spider-Man powers, plus invisibility and the "venom blast" (which itself doesn't really make sense to me because it seems to be more like an electric shock). I think a totally non-web-based Spider-Man would have been pretty interesting. 

My rating: 4 stars
