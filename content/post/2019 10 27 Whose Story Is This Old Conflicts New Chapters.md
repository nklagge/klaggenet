I love Solnit and will pretty much read anything she publishes, but when reading her collections I have the strong feeling that going cover-to-cover is the wrong approach. I usually see her LitHub essays when they come out (including some in this collection), and feel that that is a much preferable format to read her in--better to space them out over time and give yourself time to digest, because she packs many ideas into an essay and I think they reward rumination. However, I like her writing so much that I cannot stop myself from reading cover to cover when a new collection such as this one comes out. As a result, I think the essays are ultimately less clearly distinguished in my mind when I think back on them. <br /><br />Probably my favorite essay here is "Nobody Knows," which you can also read at Harper's where it was originally published: <a target="_blank" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/03/nobody-knows-3/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://harpers.org/archive/2018/03/n...</a>. It's a great mix of two main concepts--one describing the way that power permits itself ignorance (an idea I associate mostly with David Graeber), and the other describing the importance of the distinction between "a nobody" knowing an unbecoming fact and "a somebody" knowing the same fact--tied together with Solnit's own personal experience moving back and forth between being perceived as "a nobody" and "a somebody."
